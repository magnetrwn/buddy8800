# List of cards here, make sure to append cards you wish to add. Available parameters are:
# - slot: Slot number of the card [0, 18], which also determines IRQ priority (lower is higher priority).
# - type: Type of the card. Available types are: "ram", "rom", "serial".
#   - (in the future: "disk", "printer", "timer", "kbd", "display", "network").
# - at: Address of the card in the memory space.
# - range: Size or address range (like I/O register count) of the card in bytes.
# - let_collide: Allow the card to have overlapping address range with other cards.
#
# IMPORTANT: cards can be de/activated by the IORQ signal according to them being memory or I/O, so
#            you might not need to enable overlapping, as overlap of I/O and memory is expected.
#            Only use this in case of overlap of the same type of card (e.g. two RAM cards).
#
# Note: there is (usually) a limit of 18 cards in the system.
