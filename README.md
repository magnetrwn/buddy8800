# Buddy8800 -- An Altair 8800 S-100 Emulator

**An Intel 8080 emulated on an S-100 bus with a Motorola 6850 ACIA serial expansion card. Designed for running BASIC and CP/M over a PTY.**

### Getting Started

+ **[Doxygen Documentation](https://magnetrwn.github.io/buddy8800)**
+ [Building](#building)
+ [Resources and Documentation](#resources-and-documentation)
+ [Screenshots](#screenshots)

### Doxygen Documentation

You can view the [Doxygen documentation](https://magnetrwn.github.io/buddy8800), which includes this README but much more descriptive content.

### Building

+ Make sure you have installed CMake on your system.
+ Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory.
+ **Optional for testing:** Either install Catch2 globally or run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to add it as a git submodule.
+ Run `./build.sh` from the root directory. Some flags are listed next.
+ The final executable will be placed in the `bin/` directory.

By default, the build script will output a release build that has no tracing and with high optimization. To customize this behavior, some flags are available:

| Short&nbsp;Flag | Long&nbsp;Flag           | Action | Default |
|------------|---------------------|--------|------------|
| `-d`       | `--debug`           | Output a debug build, keeping symbol labels and disabling optimization |  |
| `-r`       | `--release`         | Output a release build, enabling optimization | Enabled |
|            | `--trace`           | Enable tracing, outputting information about the emulator's state after each instruction |  |
|            | `--trace-essential` | Enable tracing only for the listing of executed instructions, not the full state |  |
| `-T`       | `--tests`           | Build with tests enabled, compiling and running the Catch2 tests through CTest |  |
| `-P`       | `--perf-stat`       | Run performance metrics at the end of the build, then show the results. |  |
|            | `--perf-report`     | Run performance metrics and let the user browse detailed results. |  |
| `-V`       | `--memcheck`        | Run Valgrind's Memcheck tool on the final executable. |  |

Development builds are usually compiled with `./build.sh -d -T`.
